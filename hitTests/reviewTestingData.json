  "1117946763" : "Very good keyboard! I love it! It is sometimes a little buggy. I thought I would not be able to get used to swiping but it feels a lot better to swipe than to tap! Very good app!",
  "1142187702" : "I Mean the whole arab world speaks arabic , and you're like better add them  Serbian support cause that language is more popular !!!\nWth",
  "1143167373" : "Okay, I was able to live with some of the glitches from before and deal with the limitations, but this re-positioning of the \"switch keyboard\" icon is not even close to okay. \n\nIt was already annoying to not be able to hold the button down to choose which keyboard I wanted, but now I have to click through to emoticons first and then it's on the other side of the screen? This may be a deal breaker for me.\n\nI was hoping that the switch keyboard functionality would get better, not worse...\n\nIf you type in multiple languages, I'd recommend skipping this update.\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo I just realized you can hold the emoji button down to get the old switch keyboard back, which doubles my rating. However, I would still love to be able to choose the keyboard I want to use from that menu, rather than just \"switch to other keyboard\". That with voice dictation, and the ability to use it on the lock screen (which may be an iOS limitation) would net this app 5 stars.",
  "1117295600" : "I don't use this app anymore because of how many bugs it has....",
  "1142735452" : "I like the keyboard, but it's way too glitchy for everyday use. It frequently fails to load, leaving me with an empty gray box instead of a keyboard. It causes text conversations to appear cut off and won't allow them to be scrolled to the most recent message. It's also slow to load almost all the time. I don't know if the issues lay in the app itself or Apples implementation of third party keyboards. Either way, switched back to the standard keyboard. :(",
  "1143238652" : "But still room for improvements",
  "1142432808" : "Please add Persian language",
  "1141700151" : "Randomly: keyboard will not show up, have to close out the app and clear it from recent history then go back into it for it to work... Also can't write a review using the keyboard. Messes up the whole screen...",
  "1142698550" : "Very accurate. Still not really",
  "1143367701" : "(Ironically I can't use swiftkey, at least the new version to write this review, but...) this newest version so is improved. Keep at it. Works great.",
  "1142363781" : "The emoj update is the best!",
  "1142699229" : "It was great and shortcut words were dead on.  After the update it no longer does a thing",
  "1142319543" : "Excellent. So far, the problem with this keyboard of crashing, has been fixed in this last update. Great!",
  "1142157179" : "Add albania language ?",
  "1117532972" : "It often freezes, where you can’t type at all and you have to quit iMessages or whatever app you’re in and reopen it. Then there’s times when you’re typing a text and it covers up what you’re typing so you can’t see it. For example, if you need to scroll up and re-read what you’re responding to, it covers up what you’re typing. This happens in iMessages and other messaging apps. Another problem is that in the contacts app, when trying to add a new contact, the cursor flips to the second (last name) field before you can type the first name.",
  "1142145101" : "Wow so this works great and has all the right features!\n\nUnfortunately iOS is still a bit buggy with other keyboards. I had to switch to the standard one to write this review otherwise the text fields disappear. I think by next September with iOS 9, I'll be using Swiftkey full time.",
  "1142428266" : "Love the keyboard and the new improvements are awesome. I just want more themes. The white and black get boring. Let's get some colors. Blue, Res , Green maybe. That's the one thing that swype has over you they have lots of themes.",
  "1142302948" : "Swype doesn't work nor does correction, please fix!!!",
  "1143028586" : "Might be that ios itself is strugling with third party keyboard support allover the system.",
  "1116922918" : "Not recommended for iPad since iPhone version is great."
